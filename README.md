Windows-PowerShell
==================

These powershell scripts work for basic server configuration and can be used for server automation with respect to user input.
i.e Changing PC name, Modifying configuration files, Rebooting machines, IP configurations, Domain joining..
Requirements include a fixed IP address on the target machine connected to remote machine, and Windows Powershell 2.0 installed on the remote machine.

To be able to remotely execute a script onto the target machine, certain action has to be done on the target machine for enabling the remote execution.
Please start with RemotingExecution script for the rest to work perfectly.
